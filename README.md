# Heart-diseases-with-Logistic_regressionn
This project predicts the risk of suffering from heart disease using a logistic regression model. The primary objective was to accurately classify individuals as either having or not having heart disease based on a set of input features.
The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy score of 90%, indicating its ability to make reasonably accurate predictions.
Despite these attempts, the improvement in the model's performance was not statistically significant. It is worth noting that the accuracy achieved by the logistic regression model can still provide valuable insights for identifying potential heart disease cases. Further exploration and experimentation with different algorithms or feature engineering techniques may be warranted to enhance the predictive accuracy in future iterations of the project.
